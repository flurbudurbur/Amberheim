  # you can (and probably should) you override these in rankups.yml
  # to show the specific requirements for each rank.
  # however if you are just using money or don't need to change the message per rank, you can use any combination of:
  # {{rank.requirement('money').total | money}} {MONEY_NEEDED} {PERCENT_DONE <requirement>} {PERCENT_LEFT <requirement>} {AMOUNT <requirement>} {AMOUNT_NEEDED <requirement>}
  # {{rank.requirement('money').total | money}} and {MONEY_NEEDED} are different from {AMOUNT money} and {AMOUNT_NEEDED money} in that they use a different format.
  # here is an example of showing the requirements for just money:
  #list:
  #  complete: "&7{{rank.rankt}} &8\xbb &7{{rank.next}} &efor &7${{rank.requirement('money').total | money}}"
  #  current: "&c{{rank.rankt}} &e\xbb &c{{rank.next}} &efor &a${{rank.requirement('money').total | money}} &e{PERCENT_DONE money}%"
  #  incomplete: "&r{{rank.rankt}} &e\xbb &r{{rank.next}} &efor &a${{rank.requirement('money').total | money}}"
