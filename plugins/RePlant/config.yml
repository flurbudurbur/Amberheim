#####################

# RePlant can automatically replant harvested crops. Every player can individually
# enable or disable this feature using "/replant crops".

# Delay in seconds before replanting crops. Set to 0 to instantly replant crops.
crop-replant-delay: 1.0

# When set to true, RePlant reduces the dropped seeds by one so you don't get more
# seeds than in vanilla.
# When set to false, RePlant does not alter the drops, which means that every replanted
# crop basically results in one free seed.

# When set to true, new players will have replanting enabled by default

# Plant fallen saplings #
#########################

# Fallen down saplings can be automatically planted when they are on the correct ground type for this tree type.
plant-fallen-saplings: true

# The sapling will be automatically planted after this amount of seconds.
# Default is 120 seconds (2 minutes) so you still have time to pick it up if you like.
# Maximum is 300 seconds (5 minutes) because items despawn after 5 minutes.
# Set to 0 to instantly plant all saplings.

# When set to false, saplings thrown on the ground by a player will not be planted
plant-fallen-saplings-thrown-by-player: true

# When the current block is already blocked by another sapling, we can search for a nearby spot in a 3x3 area
# You should leave this enabled in case saplings are being stacked

# Other plugins #

# When planting saplings and WorldGuard is installed, RePlant can check if the player who threw a sapling is allowed to
# build at the place where the sapling would be planted. If not, the sapling will not be planted.
use-worldguard: true

# When planting saplings, RePlant can call a fake BlockPlaceEvent in the name of the throwing player so other plugins
# can cancel this. You probably want to leave this enabled when you are using protection plugins like WorldGuard, ...
# WARNING: Some anti cheat plugins might cancel this event. Disable this if you have problems with your anti cheat plugin!

# Update Checker #
##################

# Should we check for updates?
# When enabled, a message is printed in the console if a new version has
# been found, and OPs will be notified when they join the server.
# When set to true, we will check for updates on startup and every X hours
# When set to on-startup, we will only check on startup
# When set to false, don't check for updates

# When check-for-updates is true, AngelChest will check every X hours
