## If you want to contribute, simply follow these steps:
- Open the file you want to edit.
- Click on the pencil icon at the top right of the file.
- Edit the file as much as you want.
- Save it by going to the bottom and clicking on the "Propose changes" button.

Your changes will be made into a "Pull Request" which I will review and merge into the real deal for implementation in the server if I approve the changes.

### Beware
I will be able to see and compare the changes made to each file and I **will** read everything.
